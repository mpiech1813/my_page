    -- new game plan, thunk will update the state with the name of component which we are looking at
    -- will need on one action and 1 reducer
    -- connect Projects component redux state
-   set up redux or just a single state for true/false if visible

-   will need a separate state for each component
-   Changing the appearance of the side bar
-   ~~add a util file~~
-   ~~move the function for detecting if div is visible~~
-   !!transfer state to the navbar!!

    -- use both?: https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks
